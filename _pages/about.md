I am a tenure track Assistant Professor at the [Section for Visual Computing](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/visual-computing) at the [Technical University of Denmark (DTU)](https://www.dtu.dk/english). 

My research area is in computer vision and machine learning, with a focus on learning from images by generating them. 
I am especially interested in how we can push the boundaries of making the output of a camera closer to what we see and how we can improve 3D estimation from images and videos.

I obtained my PhD in [Differentiable Formulations for Inverse Rendering](/assets/pdf/hannemosePhDthesis.pdf) in 2020 under the supervision of [Jeppe Revall Frisvad](https://people.compute.dtu.dk/jerf/) and [Jakob Wilm](https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/persons/jaw). 
During my PhD, I did a research stay at [Cornell Tech](https://www.tech.cornell.edu/people/faculty/) where I visited [Serge Belongie](https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/575485).
